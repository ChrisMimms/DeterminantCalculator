# DeterminantCalculator
Front end calculator application for calculating the determinant of a matrix. View in browser at https://chrismimms.github.io/DeterminantCalculator/

The current version is still under developlment.  While the calculation/result is correct, assuming the user enters valid data, there 
are many todo items still, such as adding a refresh and try/catch code for incorrect user data.

Also I need to gray-out/disable the calculate button until the matrix is fully populated.
